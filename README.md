  This project is created for trading businesses that act as a provider, provide required products to business partners who do not need to deal with suppliers personally, and make work more difficult. 
The processes of trading company are;
After we received the product information from the partners, then we can bring the part number to compare with history. If we used to offer the quotation before, we can re-offer as well.
If not, our business will choose the suppliers where they give the lowest price, or the best promotions. After that, we can make the quotation back to those partners.
When the partners accept, we will make the purchase order to the suppliers and ship the products.
Trerasit Engineering Control Co.,LTD is one of the trading businesses. We face a lot of problems in collecting purchasing data, purchasing orders, and suppliers. This is the main reason why I am interested in building an application that serves these problems.
